# Breast Cancer Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on a set of features extracted from digital images of breast masses.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 569 entries and 33 columns. The `diagnosis` column serves as the target variable, indicating whether the tumor is **malignant** (M) or **benign** (B). The features extracted from the images are as follows:

### Dataset Columns
- **id**: Unique identifier for each entry.
- **diagnosis**: Target variable (M = Malignant, B = Benign).
- **radius_mean**: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
- **texture_mean**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
- **perimeter_mean**: Mean perimeter of the tumor.
- **area_mean**: Mean area of the tumor.
- **smoothness_mean**: Mean of local variation in radius lengths.
- **compactness_mean**: Mean of (PerimeterÂ² / Area) - 1.0.
- **concavity_mean**: Mean severity of concave portions of the contour.
- **concave points_mean**: Mean number of concave points on the tumor boundary.
- **symmetry_mean**: Mean symmetry of the tumor.
- **fractal_dimension_mean**: Mean "coastline approximation" - 1.

Additional statistical variations and worst-case values are included in the following columns:
- `_se` columns (e.g., `radius_se`, `texture_se`) indicate standard error for the respective feature.
- `_worst` columns (e.g., `radius_worst`, `texture_worst`) represent the worst values for the respective feature.

### Missing or Unused Columns
- **Unnamed: 32**: Contains no data and will be dropped during preprocessing.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Dropping unused columns (e.g., `Unnamed: 32`).
   - Handling missing or duplicate entries.
   - Scaling features for uniformity using standardization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing feature distributions for malignant and benign cases.
   - Correlation analysis to identify important features.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Training multiple machine learning models, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessing models using metrics like:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-Score
   - Visualizing results through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Making predictions on new data to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
